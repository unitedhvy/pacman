The user directs Pacman around a grid eating pieces of cheese and
avoiding red monsters. The objective is to eat all the cheese before running 
into a monster. The 'r' key should reset the game, monsters can overlap monsters
and cheese. 

AIPacman adds weighting to tiles to help automate Pacman's search for cheese. Lower value tiles are safer, while higher value tiles indicate proximity to ghosts.
